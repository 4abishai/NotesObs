- The SDGs are a set of 17 global goals adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015 to be achieved by 2030.

- They are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all.

- The 17 goals are integrated, recognizing that action in one area affects others, and requiring a balance of social, economic and environmental sustainability.

- The principle of "Leaving No One Behind" commits countries to prioritizing progress for those furthest behind first.

- The SDGs aim to reach several critical "zeros" by 2030, including zero poverty, hunger, AIDS and discrimination against women and girls.

- Achieving the ambitious SDG targets requires participation, resources and efforts from all sectors of society - governments, private sector, civil society and individuals.

- The creativity, knowledge, technology and finances from all stakeholders are necessary to implement the SDGs in every context and country.

**Note**: **Multidimensional Poverty**
*A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time* â€“ for example they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty.
