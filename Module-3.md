### Benefits of trade for less developed countries:

1. **Access to essential materials:** Trade provides access to capital goods, machinery, raw materials, and semi-finished goods that are indispensable for economic development.

2. **Transfer of knowledge and skills**: Trade facilitates the dissemination of technological knowledge, ideas, know-how, skills, managerial talents, and entrepreneurship from other countries.

3. **Capital inflow**: Trade serves as a vehicle for the international movement of capital, especially from *developed to underdeveloped countries*.

4. **Promotion of competition**: *Free international trade acts as an anti-monopoly policy* and helps maintain a healthy degree of competition by *preventing domestic monopolies*.

In essence, trade provides less developed countries with access to vital resources, knowledge, capital, and competitive markets, which are crucial for economic growth and development.

### Gains from International Trade

The gains from international trade under two heads.

#### 1. Static gains

Static gains arise from the *optimal utilization* of a country's **factor resources**, contributing to increased *national output* and *social welfare*. These gains include:

1. **Specialization and division of labor:** International trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods where they have a *comparative cost advantage*, leading to specialization and a geographical division of labor. This brings the advantages of specialization to the international level.

2. **Maximization of production:** As a result of specialization, each country seeks to produce as much as possible of the goods it has a comparative advantage in. This leads to maximization of the world's total output.

3. **Maximization of welfare:** By maximizing total production, more goods are available for consumption worldwide, positively impacting economic welfare globally.

4. **Rise in national income:** International trade increases *employment* and *production*, resulting in a rise in national income and per capita income.

5. **Use of surplus resources:** Trade provides opportunities for countries to exploit their surplus resources by *widening the market* accessible to them.

#### 2. Dynamic gains

Those gains that contribute significantly to the promotion of *economic growth of the trading countries concerned*.

1. **Widening of the market:** International trade enlarges the market size for products, allowing *surplus output to be exported*. This encourages greater specialization, innovation. This leads to productivity gains, profitability, and economic growth.

2. **Educative benefits:** There is a transfer of skills, technical know-how, managerial expertise, and ideas across trading nations. Less developed countries especially benefit as recipients of these skills.

3. **Efficient resource utilization:** Trade based on *comparative advantage* leads to more efficient utilization of resources in each trading country, with *resources employed in their most productive uses*.

4. **Capital accumulation:** The desire to import foreign goods and *raise consumption motivates higher savings and capital accumulation* within a country.

5. **Capital movements:** Trade facilitates movements of capital across countries, which is advantageous especially for less developed nations *receiving investment inflows*.

6. **Advantages for less developed countries:** These nations can import capital goods, technologies, skills and expertise through trade, *accelerating their economic growth prospects*.

### Prebisch-Singer thesis:

1. *Terms of trade* have secularly declined against *primary commodity* exporters (developing countries) and in favor of *manufactured goods* exporters (developed countries).

2. Based on UK export data from 1870-1940, Raul Prebisch showed that terms of trade tended to move against primary products and in favor of manufactured/capital goods.

3. H.W. Singer provided supporting evidence for this thesis.

4. Less developed countries (LDCs) have had to export *larger amounts of primary products to import the same quantity of manufactured goods* from advanced nations.

5. There has been technical progress in the advanced countries, the fruit of which have not percolated to the LDC’s.

6. Developed countries maintain *monopolistic control over production of industrial goods*, allowing them to manipulate prices in their favor against LDC interests.

7. With a few exceptions like OPEC raising oil prices, international prices of agricultural, mineral and forestry products from LDCs have *relatively declined*.

8. Consequently, the terms of trade have remained unfavorable and deteriorated for developing primary commodity-exporting nations.

#### Assumptions in the Prebisch-Singer thesis

(i) As *income rises* in the advanced countries, the pattern of *demand shifts from primary products to the manufactured products* due to Engel’s law.

(ii) There is *slow rise in demand for products* in the developed countries.

(iii) The export market for product of LDC’s is **competitive**.

(iv) The export market for products of developed countries is **monopolistic**.

(v) Wages and prices are low in LDC’s.

(vi) The appearance of *substitutes* for products of LDC’s *reduces demand* for
them.

(vii) *The economic growth in the LDC’s is indicated by income terms of trade.*

#### Why there is decline in the prices of export products of these countries?

Firstly, a *high proportion of profits from exports are not available* for
imports.

Secondly, there is an *increased pressure upon the LDC’s to raise exports* in
order to *repay external debts* on account of *IMF-induced adjustment*
*polices*.

These pressures make the debt- ridden LDC’s to *compete with other poor*
*countries* to enlarge their export earnings.

It results in decline in the prices of export products of these countries.

#### CRITICISM

1. **Not Firm Basis for Inference:** The inference of *secularly deteriorating terms of trade* for LDCs *rests solely on the exports of primary vs manufactured products*, which may not be a robust basis.

2. **Faulty Gains/Losses Measurement**: Economists like Jagdish Bhagwati argue that the terms of trade index used *understates the actual gains* to primary product exporters.

3. **Flawed TOT(terms of trade) Index**: The index overlooks qualitative product changes, new product varieties, services like transportation etc. 

4. **Neglects Supply Conditions:** The thesis *only considers demand conditions* in determining terms of trade, neglecting supply-side factors.

5. **Little Real Monopoly Power Effect:** The argument that monopoly power in manufacturing worsens LDCs' terms of trade has little empirical evidence.

6. **Benefits from Foreign Investment:** While the thesis claims productivity gains are not transmitted through lower prices, *LDCs have benefited from product innovations and improvements through foreign investment inflows*.

7. **Neglects Quality Improvements:** Improvements in quality of manufactured goods are not accounted for in the pricing analysis.

In essence, the critics argue the thesis oversimplifies the terms of trade issue, relies on flawed metrics, neglects supply factors and quality changes, and overstates monopoly power while understating gains to LDCs from technology transfers.

### Myrdal theses

1. **Cumulative Causation:**
- Initial economic advantages lead to further growth, while initial disadvantages create a vicious cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.
- The *international trading system reinforces existing inequalities* between developed and developing nations.

2. **Structural Dependency:**
- Developing countries face dependency due to their reliance on exporting primary commodities.
- This makes them *vulnerable in the global economy* without diversification into manufacturing.

3. **State/Government Intervention:**
- Myrdal advocated for *active state intervention and economic planning* to address trade imbalances.
- He proposed policies like **import substitution industrialization (ISI)** to develop *domestic industries* and *economic planning* was recommended to promote more *equitable development*.

4. **Criticism of Free Trade:**
- He argued it *perpetuated the exploitative trade patterns* and *reinforced underdevelopment*.

In essence, Myrdal highlighted how existing trade patterns created vicious cycles of poverty, advocating for state-led industrialization and planning by developing countries to break out of this structural dependency on primary exports. His views challenged the free trade consensus.

#### Free Trade
The free trade perspective advocates for the absence of barriers or restrictions on international movement of goods and services. Its key arguments are:

1. **Comparative Advantage:** Allows countries to specialize in products where they have an advantage, increasing efficiency, productivity and economic growth.

2. **Lower Prices and Variety:** Eliminating trade barriers promotes *competition, lowering prices* and increasing product variety for consumers, enhancing welfare.

3. **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Countries can focus resources on industries with a comparative advantage, optimizing resource utilization and overall efficiency.

4. **Global Integration:** Promotes economic integration, interdependence and cooperation across nations, reducing conflicts through shared economic interests.

### World Trade Organization

- Global organization that deals directly with making *rules* and *regulations* among the Nations with respect to trading.
- WTO also acts as a forum that *negotiates the trading agreement* and *settles down trading disputes* among countries by providing support and a full feeling of the needs of developing countries.

#### Objectives of the WTO

- WTO aims to *reduce barriers to trade* and *promote economic growth* and development among its member countries.
- To limit the *trading barriers by negotiating*. WTO settles disputes in accordance with the **Dispute Settlement process**. This results in a reduction in the *prices of goods and services*, which in turn results in a reduction in the *cost of living*.
- Stimulating economic growth and development, and employment *opportunities*.
- Limit the cost of international business activities.
- To promote the concept of *good governance*.
- To reduce the *trade disputes* among the countries.
- Collaborating with leading financial institutions to *boost economic management*.

#### Functions of WTO
- The functions of the WTO are numerous and critical in facilitating a fair and open international trade system.
- It regulates the laws related to trade agreements.
- Organise the conferences for trade negotiations.
- Sort out and resolve the issues related to trading.
- Examines trade-related policies.
- Consult and cooperate with economic organisations.
#### Role of Trade

- The main objective behind the emergence of the WTO is to maintain the *free flow of trade* as much as possible without any undesirable consequences like *unfair competition, hegemony* in a certain variety of goods or services, *biassed* trade policies, etc.
- WTO helps the *inclusion of developing countries* in the international trading system and helps them to achieve economic growth and ensure full employment.
- It oversees the trade rules and policies governing international trade and ensures that they are *transparent* and easily *predictable*.

####  WTO as pillar of Economic Relations
- *Dispute settlement* is the central pillar of the **multilateral trading system**, and the WTO’s unique contribution to the stability of the global economy.
- The primary goal of WTO is to give an open and free trade space to international traders where they can do trading without any obstruction.
- It makes and implements the rules related to international trading.
- It creates a venue for liberalisation negotiation and trade monitoring.
- It makes decisions that are more *transparent* and *fair* with all the member countries.
- It also *works with other important economic Institutions* and works actively for *Global economic management*.
- It opens the ground and *provides a platform to the countries* that can take advantage of WTO for the global Trading system.

#### Developing Country Status in WTO

- There are no WTO definitions of “developed” and “developing” countries. Members announce for themselves whether they are “developed” or “developing” countries.

- However, other members can challenge the decision of a member to make use of provisions available to developing countries.

- The WTO Agreements contain special provisions which give developing countries special rights. These provisions are referred to as **Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) provisions**.

##### Special Provisions:
- *Longer time periods* for implementing Agreements and commitments.
- Measures to *increase trading opportunities* for developing countries,
- Provisions requiring all WTO members to *safeguard the trade interests* of developing countries.
- Support to help *developing countries build the capacity* to carry out WTO work, handle disputes, and implement technical standards.
- *Provisions* related to least-developed country (LDC) Members.

#### Benefits for developing countries in WTO:

1. **Promotion of Economic Development:** The WTO agreement specifies that international trade should benefit the economic development of developing and least-developed countries.

2. **Import Restrictions**: Under the **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**, developing countries have the *right to restrict imports* if it helps *establish* or *protect* a domestic industry or addresses balance of payments difficulties.

3. **Non-Reciprocal Preferential Treatment**: Part IV of GATT allows for non-reciprocal preferential treatment, where developed countries can grant *trade concessions* to developing countries without expecting matching concessions in return.

4. **Special and Differential Treatment provisions**: The WTO agreements contain special provisions which give developing countries *special rights* through "special and differential treatment" measures.

5. **Longer Implementation Periods**: Developing countries are given longer transition periods to implement and comply with WTO agreements and commitments.

However, developing countries have criticized that Part IV lacks enforceability as it does not legally obligate developed nations to provide preferential treatment. Overall, while supportive provisions exist, their effectiveness has been questioned by some developing nations.

### Foreign Trade

- Foreign Trade is the exchange of goods and services between two countries in the international market.

- It helps in the availability of raw material/finished product in a country that either does not have it or has it in scarcity.

- No country is self-sufficient in terms of natural or man-made resources, so it is prudent to approach other countries that have them in abundance.

#### Types of Foreign Trade
**Import trade**: It is the purchase of goods and services by one country from another country. Here the flow of goods is from a foreign land to the home nation. Countries import goods and services when they need raw materials for producing goods or when they need a finished product for domestic consumption.

**Export trade**: It is the selling of goods and services to another country. Here the flow of goods is from the home nation to a foreign land. Countries export goods and services to another nation when they have that particular commodity in surplus.

**Entrepot trade**: This process is also called **re-export**. In this form of trade, a business purchases goods or services from one country, *reprocesses* those products, and then sells them to another country.

#### Benefits of Foreign Trade:
**Foreign Exchange**: Foreign Trade helps countries get *access to foreign currency and boost up their reserves*. This currency is essential when it comes to paying for imports of goods and services.

**Consumers get more options**: People from one country enjoy superior quality goods and services from other nations. They would not have gained access to these products were it not for International trade. These products can also help them improve their standard of living in the long run.

**Optimum use of a nation’s resources**: No country can fulfil all its consumption needs independently. They have to depend on other nations for specific products. International trade allows them to procure raw materials/finished products that they don’t have. It helps countries focus on producing what they are good at and help increase efficiency in the production process of those products.

**Economic Benefits**: International trade generates *employment opportunities* for organisations and countries involved in the export/entrepot of goods and services. It also helps to improve the *Gross Domestic Product* for that country.

### Foreign Investment

Foreign Investment is the inflow of capital into a country through individuals/institutions from a different country.

The flow of capital is from one organisation, with its headquarters in a foreign nation, into another company that belongs to the home nation.

The investment helps companies based abroad to set up their offices or manufacturing units in another country.

Since the foreign entity gets a stake in the domestic company in exchange for providing capital, they have to follow local government rules and regulations regarding such investments.

#### Types of Foreign Investment
**Foreign Direct Investment**: This type of investment involves a foreign company *infusing capital* into another country’s *business* or *production units*.

**Foreign Portfolio Investment**: When an organisation based outside the country invests in the *securities market* of that country, it becomes a foreign portfolio investment.

**Foreign Institutional Investment**: This is a form of investment by a foreign-based company in the *passive holdings of an entity* in another country.

#### Benefits of Foreign Investment
**Economic growth**: Infusion of foreign capital helps domestic companies *increase production and generate employment*. It can also *boost consumption* in the market since the workforce in those companies will have greater purchasing power. It contributes to the overall growth of a country’s economy.

**Resource transfer**: Foreign investment brings capital and helps the domestic workforce get *access to new technologies and skills*. It will help in improving their *productivity* while also developing the quality of goods and services produced.

**Cost benefits**: Foreign investment can help domestic companies improve *production efficiency* and reduce costs via *access to better technologies*.
