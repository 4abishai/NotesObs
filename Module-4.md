### Environment as Necessity

- **Importance of the Environment**:
  - The environment is essential for human survival and provides various services to humanity.
  - Life cannot exist without the environment's support.
  - People, plants, and animals depend on the environment for survival.

- **Services Provided by the Environment**:
  1. **Supply of Resources**: Provides both renewable and non-renewable resources like wood, soil, and land.
  2. **Sustains Life**: Includes the sun, soil, water, and air, essential for human life, and sustains life by providing genetic and biodiversity.
  3. **Assimilation of Waste**: Helps in getting rid of waste generated by production and consumption activities, mostly in the form of garbage.
  4. **Enhances Quality of Life**: Enhances quality of life by providing natural beauty like rivers, mountains, and deserts, which add to the overall quality of life.

### Environment as Luxury
  - There is a growing demand for environmental resources and services, but their supply is limited due to overuse and misuse.
  - As a result, the environment has become a luxury.
  - In the modern era, we can produce modern equipment and products from natural resources to make our lives more efficient and comfortable.
  - **Focus on Comfort**:
	  - The main goal is to gain comfort, which is why these needs are considered luxury needs.

### Impact of Environment Degradation
- **Impact on Human Health**:
  - Environmental degradation can lead to health issues, such as respiratory problems from exposure to toxic air pollutants.

- **Loss of Biodiversity**:
  - Biodiversity loss affects the ecosystem's balance, leading to issues like pollution, nutrient restoration, water source protection, and climate stabilization.

- **Ozone Layer Depletion**:
  - Depletion of the ozone layer, caused by substances like chlorofluorocarbons, can result in harmful ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth.

- **Impact on Tourism**:
  - Environmental damage, such as loss of green cover and biodiversity, and increased pollution, can negatively impact the tourism industry, which relies on a healthy environment.

- **Economic Impact**:
  - Environmental degradation can lead to significant economic costs, such as restoration of green cover, cleanup of landfills, and protection of endangered species.
  - It can also result in economic losses for the tourism industry.

### Burden of population on the environment
- **Overexploitation of Resources**:
  - Increasing fishing and hunting can lead to reduced populations of exploited species and indirectly increase numbers of non-exploited species due to changes in resource availability.

- **Introduction of Invasive Species**:
  - Increased transport of invasive species, either intentionally or accidentally, occurs as people travel and import/export supplies. Urbanization creates environments where invasive species thrive and outcompete native species.

- **Transmission of Diseases**:
  - Densely populated areas can facilitate the rapid spread of diseases within and among populations. Easy and frequent transportation can also lead to the quick spread of diseases to new regions.

- **Resource Extraction**: There's an increase in extracting fossil fuels, minerals, trees, water, and wildlife, especially in oceans. This process often releases pollutants and waste, harming air and water quality and human and animal health.

- **Burning of Fossil Fuels**: The rise in fossil fuel burning for energy, electricity generation, transportation, and industrial processes contributes to pollution and climate change.

- **Freshwater Use**: Population growth leads to more freshwater extraction from lakes, rivers, groundwater, and reservoirs for drinking, agriculture, recreation, and industry.

- **Ecological Impact**: Urbanization and agricultural expansion to support growing populations lead to habitat destruction, deforestation, and disturbance, reducing species populations, biodiversity, and altering ecosystems.

### Rural Development and Environment
- **Increased Food Production**: To meet the food needs of rapidly growing populations, food production in developing countries must increase by at least 50% in the next three decades.

- **Sustainable Resource Use**: Overexploitation of land in many developing areas necessitates radical changes in how resources are distributed, used, and managed in agriculture.

- **Promoting Sustainable Farming**: Making agricultural inputs more accessible to small farmers and promoting sustainable farming practices can provide environmentally friendly alternatives to current resource-intensive practices.

- **Investing in Land**: Land-augmenting investments can boost yields from cultivated land, ensuring future food self-sufficiency while minimizing environmental impact.

### Urban Development and Environment
- **Rapid Urbanization**: Heavy rural-urban migration leads to rapid urban population growth, often at rates double that of national growth.

- **Strain on Infrastructure**: Governments struggle to cope with the increased strain on urban water supplies and sanitation facilities.

- **Health Hazards**: Environmental problems in urban areas, such as pollution and inadequate sanitation, pose health hazards to growing populations, increasing the risk of epidemics and health crises.

- **Illegal Housing**: Much urban housing is illegal under existing legislation, making private investments risky and leaving portions of urban populations ineligible for government services.

- **Environmental Costs**: Congestion, vehicular and industrial emissions, and poorly ventilated household stoves contribute to the high environmental costs of urban crowding.

### Market Failure
Market failure is a concept that describes the inefficient distribution of goods and services in a free market. In a free market, prices are determined by supply and demand, leading to a price equilibrium. The equilibrium price is the *price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree*. Market failure occurs when there is a state of disequilibrium due to market distortions, such as *monopoly power, price limits, minimum wage requirements, or government regulations*, leading to the quantity of goods supplied not being equal to the quantity demanded.

#### Causes of Market Failures: Externality:
   - **Definition**: An externality is a cost or benefit from a **transaction** that affects a third party not involved in the transaction.
   - **Types**:
     - **Positive Externality**: Provides a positive effect on the third party. For example, public education benefits not just the students but society as a whole.
     - **Negative Externality**: Causes a negative effect on a third party. For example, cigarette smoking harms not only the smoker but also those around them.
