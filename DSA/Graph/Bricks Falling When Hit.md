You are given an `m x n` binary `grid`, where each `1` represents a brick and `0` represents an empty space. A brick is **stable** if:

- It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
- At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is **stable**.

You are also given an array `hits`, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location `hits[i] = (rowi, coli)`. The brick on that locationÂ (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will **fall**. Once a brick falls, it is **immediately** erased from the `grid` (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

Return _an array_ `result`_, where each_ `result[i]` _is the number of bricks that will **fall** after the_ `ith` _erasure is applied._

**Note** that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.
