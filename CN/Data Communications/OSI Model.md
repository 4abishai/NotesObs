### Summary of the OSI Model

- **Open System**: 
  - Set of protocols enabling communication between any two different systems *regardless of architecture*.

- **OSI Model Framework**:
  - A layered structure with *seven* separate but *related layers*.
  - Each layer defines a *part of the process* for moving information across a network.

- **Purpose of OSI Model**:
  - Facilitate communication between different systems without changing underlying hardware and software logic.
  - It is not a protocol but a *framework* for understanding and designing *flexible*, *robust*, and *interoperable* network architectures.
  - Allows communication between all types of computer systems.
