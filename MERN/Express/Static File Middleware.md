`app.use(express.static())` is a built-in middleware function in Express.js that serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.

When you call `app.use(express.static(root))`, where `root` is the directory from which you want to serve static files, Express will automatically handle requests for files in the specified directory and send them to the client.

Here's how it works:

1. The `express.static()` function takes a path as an argument, which specifies the root directory from which to serve static files.
2. When a client requests a file (e.g., `/styles.css`), Express looks for the requested file in the specified root directory.
3. If the file is found, Express automatically reads the file and sends its contents back to the client.
4. If the file is not found, Express moves on to the next middleware function in the stack.

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const path = require('path')

// setup static and middleware
app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, './public')))

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, './navbar-app/index.html'))
})

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send('Resource Not Found')
})

app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port: 5000')
})
```

This code sets up a basic Express.js server. Let's break it down:

1. `const express = require('express')`: This line imports the Express.js library, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js.

2. `const app = express()`: This line creates an instance of the Express application.

3. `const path = require('path')`: This line imports the built-in `path` module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

4. `app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, './public')))`: This line sets up a middleware in Express to serve static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, and images) from the `./public` directory. The `path.resolve(__dirname, './public')` resolves the full path to the `public` directory relative to the current directory (`__dirname`).

5. `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... })`: This line defines a route handler for the root URL (`/`). When a client makes a GET request to the root URL, the callback function is executed.

6. `res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, './navbar-app/index.html'))`: Inside the route handler callback function, this line sends the `index.html` file located in the `./navbar-app` directory to the client. The `path.resolve` function is used again to get the full path to the `index.html` file.

7. `app.listen(5000, () => { ... })`: This line starts the Express server and listens for incoming requests on port 5000. The callback function is executed when the server starts listening, and it logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running on port 5000.

In summary, this code sets up an Express.js server that serves static files from the `./public` directory and sends the `index.html` file from the `./navbar-app` directory when the root URL (`/`) is requested. The server listens for incoming requests on port 5000.

1. **`app.use`**:
   - `app.use` is a method in Express.js used to mount middleware functions.
   - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
   - `app.use` is responsible for adding new middleware functions to the middleware stack.
   - These middleware functions can perform tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, adding response headers, and more.
   - The `app.use` function takes the middleware function as an argument, and it can also take a path as the first argument to specify that the middleware function should only be executed for requests to that path.

2. **`express.static`**:
   - `express.static` is a built-in middleware function in Express.js.
   - It serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets from a specified directory.
   - When you call `express.static(root)`, where `root` is the directory from which you want to serve static files, it returns a middleware function that can be mounted using `app.use`.
   - This middleware function automatically handles requests for static files and serves them to the client.
   - If a requested file is not found in the specified directory, Express moves on to the next middleware function in the stack.

In the line `app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, './public')))`:
- `express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, './public'))` is a middleware function that serves static files from the `./public` directory relative to the current directory (`__dirname`).
- `app.use(...)` mounts this middleware function in the Express application's middleware stack.

#### Common Approach
```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const path = require('path')

// setup static and middleware
app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, './public')))

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send('Resource Not Found')
})

app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port: 5000')
})
app.all('*', (req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send('Resource Not Found')
})
```

This code sets up an Express.js server that serves static files from the `./public` directory and handles all unmatched routes by sending a "Resource Not Found" message with a 404 status code.
